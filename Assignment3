1.	Functions reduce the need for duplicate code. This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update.
2.	The code in a function executes when the function is called, not when the function is defined.
3.	The def statement defines (that is, creates) a function.
4.	A function consists of the def statement and the code in its def clause.
5.	A function call is what moves the program execution into the function, and the function call evaluates to the function’s return value.
6.	There is one global scope, and a local scope is created whenever a function is called.
7.	When a function returns, the local scope is destroyed, and all the variables in it are forgotten.
8.	A return value is the value that a function call evaluates to. Like any value, a return value can be used as part of an expression.
9.	If there is no return statement for a function, its return value is None.
10.	A global statement will force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable.
11.	The data type of None is NoneType.
12.	That import statement imports a module named areallyourpetsnamederic. (This isn’t a real Python module, by the way.)
13.	This function can be called with spam.bacon().
14.	Place the line of code that might cause an error in a try clause.
15.	The code that could potentially cause an error goes in the try clause.
16.	The code that executes if an error happens goes in the except clause.
