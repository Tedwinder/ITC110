1. What is []?
[] is an empty list, which is a list value that contains no items. 

2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in a variable named spam? (Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].)

spam[2] = 'hello' 

3. What does spam[int(int('3' * 2) // 11)] evaluate to?

'd' 

4. What does spam[-1] evaluate to?

'd' 

5.  What does spam[:2] evaluate to?
['a', 'b']

For the following three questions, let’s say bacon contains the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True].

6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?
1

7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?

[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?

[3.14, 11, 'cat', True]

9. What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?

The operator for list concatenation is +. The operator for replication is *. 

10  What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?

Append() adds values to the end of a list.  Insert() can add them anywhere in the list.

11. What are two ways to remove values from a list?

The del statement and the remove() list method.

12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.

Both lists and strings can be passed to len(), have indexes and slices, be used in for loops, be concatenated or replicated, and be used with the in and not in operators.

13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?

Lists are mutable; they can have values added, removed, or changed. Tuples are immutable; they cannot be changed at all. Also, tuples are written using parentheses, ( and ), while lists use the square brackets, [ and ].

14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?
(42,) 

15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a tuple value?

The tuple() and list() functions convert into the respective values. 

16. Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly. What do they contain instead?

They contain references to list values.

17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?

The copy.copy() function will do a shallow copy of a list, while the copy.deepcopy() function will do a deep copy of a list. A deepcopy copies lists inside lists, but a regular copy does not.
